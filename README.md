# MathDesignVideo
This repository features the files used in my famous mathematician design project. 
What is this?
I have chose to make my design project video organized using Version control software GitHub. While it's usually used for software, it also doubles as the perfect tool for file organization. This helps me to save files and make stock footage/music used easy to access.
