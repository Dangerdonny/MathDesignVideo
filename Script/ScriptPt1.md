Today I will be talking about space. 
A person who played a key role in NACA, the predicessor to NASA, and NASA.

At this moment, you might think I'm talking about an astronaut, but I'm not.

I am talking about a person who helped keep ships running, send sattelites into space, got considered a human computer, and became an expert at a programming language that is still used today; known as FORTRAN. To set a better perspective, this was back in the later 1900's.

Now that you know that I am not talking about an astronaut but rather a genious on the ground, you might think I am talking about a white male with no cares and no cares and a ton o priveledge. But I am not. In fact, I am talking about an african-american female, doin all this even when she was seperated from everyone else at NACA for being a different race. I am talking about Dorothy Johnson Vaughan, a math teacher who ended up getting hired at NACA while segregation in the work force was still in place.
