On 9/20/1910, Dorothy Johnson was born. Her parents were Annie Johnson and Leonard johnson, she got the second last name from her husband, Howard Vaughan who she married in 1932 after graduating from Beechurst High school and Wilberfroce university, where she got a bachelor of science degree.

After she got married, she started working at Robert Russa Moton High school in Farmville, Virginia. Although it used to be a school, it got renovated into a mueseum in 2001.This job lasted from 1932 until 1943.

After that job, she got emloyed as a mathmetician at NACA, the orginization that came before NASA. This seemed like a temporary job, but it soon became more than a temporary job.

But with getting this job, segregation made the work she was able to do limited. Dorothy Vaughan waas limited to only being allowed to work in the "West area Computing unit" . 

She was only allowed to work other african-americans in her area at NACA. Although, she calculated mathematical computations for engineers.

After a while o this, Dorothy Vaughan promoted to the manager of the West Area Computers. This job fianally allowed her to collarobrate with well-known computer operators.

When NACA fianally changed to NASA, they stopped the segregation of mathmetitians and astronauts alike. 

This gave Dorothy the ability to work t the analysis and computation division, giving her the oppourtunity to learn the FORTRAN computer language, which she became an expert at.

One of her last big projects was on the SCOUT program, which sent sattillites into orbit. 

From there, she did a few smaller missions as well as helping NASA mathmetitions Katherine G. Johnson and Mary Jackson to launch the astronaut John Glenn into orbit.

In 1971, she made the decision to retire in 1971.
